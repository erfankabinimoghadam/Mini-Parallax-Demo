# Mini Parallax Demo

This is a simple parallax scrolling demo built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The effect makes the background move slower than the foreground content, creating a depth illusion.

## Features

- Full-width parallax section
- Smooth scrolling effect
- Easy to customize with your own images
- Lightweight and minimal setup

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Scroll to see the parallax effect.
4. Replace the background image URL in `style.css` to use your own image.

## How It Works

- The parallax effect is achieved using JavaScript to move the background and foreground at different speeds relative to scroll.
- The background moves slower, giving a sense of depth.
- The foreground moves faster or at normal scroll speed.
